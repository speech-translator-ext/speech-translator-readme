## Description

**This web browser extension can translate any video, audio or livestream in real-time.**

It uses speech recognition technology to convert speech from any source into text: the transcribing process. Then it translates the text from one language to another using the selected service.

You can use it for:
- üéûÔ∏è Transcribing and translating livestreams, videos, calls, etc.
- üé§ Transcribing and translating your speech for a livestream overlay in OBS (for livestreamers)
- üñ•Ô∏è Real-time computer-assisted translation (basically human translation)
- üìñ Practicing language learning by dictating the text and reading the translation
- üî† Creating translated subtitles or captions for videos or podcasts
- üë©‚Äçüíª Creating a non-machine translation using the textual version of spoken words (called transcript)
- üëÇ Enhancing accessibility for people with hearing impairments
The extension can be used on Android with Kiwi Browser.
